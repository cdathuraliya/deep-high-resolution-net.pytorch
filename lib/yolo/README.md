# YOLO person detection

Can be used as a replacement for default Faster R-CNN detection (slower compared to YOLOv3).

YOLO files are taken from [https://github.com/DeNA/PyTorch_YOLOv3](https://github.com/DeNA/PyTorch_YOLOv3). Only minimal changes (in imports) to original files.

Place [yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) under `demo` directory.
